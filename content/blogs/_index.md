Here, I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on software development, programming languages, and industry trends.

### My Tech Stack *(not a tech stack really)*

- **TypeScript**: For both frontend and backend development
- **Rust**: For building high-performance CLIs and applications
- **Go**: i used it few times and i liked it

I'm always exploring new technologies and sharing my learnings here.

In the **frontend world**, i like reactjs a lot and i am  not opinoniated about using any meta framework at all i use whatever works and serves the main purpose.
